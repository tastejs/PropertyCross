    By default, Sass comes with a <code>lightness()</code> function, which returns the expected value from the HSLa system of colors. To properly judge readability, though, we have to look at perceived brightness. This class adds a <code>brightness()</code> function to Sass, as well as <code>luminosity()</code> so we can easily generate a readable text color from the background.<br><br>

    The sample below shows the lightness value (all are the same), but will show the brightness value as you mouse over the examples.
