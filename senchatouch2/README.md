##Introduction

[Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch) is a framework for building cross-platform mobile application using HTML5 technologies.  Similar to ExtJS, Sencha Touch provides a fully functional JavaScript API and a structured MVC approach for building mobile applications.  Coding is done (almost!) exclusively in JavaScript - with the majority of the HTML and CSS being abstracted away behind the concept of "components", which are configured and generated by the JavaScript code.

The PropertyCross implementation does not use any additional tools or libraries beyond those supplied by Sencha, with one exception - it makes use of PhoneGap Build to build and package the application as a native app (although it does not make use of the PhoneGap APIs itself).  This implementation also uses the default "Sencha" theme to style it - whereas other frameworks have attempted to mimic the default look and feel of native applications, Sencha Touch has opted for provided its own styling which provides a clean interface which looks the same on both iOS and Android browsers.

## Building the Application

Applications developed with Sencha Touch can be run directly within a web browser control. Because the application uses XHR in order to load templates, if you run the application from your local file system you will encounter problems due to the [same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy). You can solve this either by serving the app from a web server, or by using one of the [Chrome switches](http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/) that disables this policy.

We have been unable to get the successfully produce a native package using the [native packaging guide](http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/#!/guide/native_packaging) so have opted to build the native binary using PhoneGap instead. N.B. This doesn't seem to be an uncommon approach from a quick search of their forums but we would ideally use their tooling if it worked. For Windows Phone PhoneGap is the recommended packaging method.

* Install the [Sencha Cmd Tool](http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/) (previously this required Sencha SDK tools for <= SenchaTouch 2.0).
* Open a terminal (must be cmd on Windows) and run -
`...\senchatouch2>sencha app build --environment package`
* Create a zip archive out of the `build/package` folder and upload it to [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/).

If you clone this project you'll see that the build/package folder is setup as a submodule pointing to another [github repo](https://github.com/chrisprice/PropertyCross-ST2.git). This allows us to make use of the public [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/254779/builds) service to produce native binaries.

For the Windows Phone 8 build, PhoneGap build does not currently support WP8, however the same files in build/package can be dropped into a new PhoneGap project without modification.

##Application Structure

 + `\.sencha` - Sencha project and workspace files.
 + `\app\controller` - Contains the application business logic.
 + `\app\model` - Configures persisted model objects.
 + `\app\store` - Sencha data stores representing either collections of data loaded from the server, or persisted model objects.
 + `\app\util` - Simple utility functions.
 + `\app\view` - The various Sencha views used by the app.
 + `\assets` - icons and splashscreens used by PhoneGap, these are generated via the [PropertyCross build system](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/PropertyCross/tree/master/build).
 + `\cordova-wp8` - A Windows Phone Cordova / PhoneGap project. This is used because PhoneGap Build does not support WP8.
 + `\resources` - The Sencha standard styles and customisation (SASS/CSS).
 + `\touch` - The Sencha Touch framework JS files.
 + `app.js` - The application bootstrap.
 + `app.json` - Application metadata/config.
 + `build.xml` - Sencha build process configuration.
 + `config.xml` - The XML file that is used by PhoneGap Build in order to package the app.
 + `index.html` - The host HTML page for this app.
 + `phonegap.js` - The PhoneGap JavaScript APIs.
 + `stats-config.json` - Used by the PropertyCross build in order to compute code sharing metrics.
