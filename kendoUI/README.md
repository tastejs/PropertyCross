KendoUI PropertyCross
=================

This is an implementation of the PropertyCross application using [Kendo UI Mobile](http://www.kendoui.com/), a commercial framework for creating mobile UIs that mimic the native look and feel of mobile applications using HTML.

Kendo provides a suite of web development frameworks, all of which are built on top of he 'core' Kendo UI MVVM framework. The Kendo UI Mobile framework adds a set of UI widgets for the creation of mobile interfaces. The mobile framework has a look and feel that mimics the native Apple, Android and Windows Phone themes.
