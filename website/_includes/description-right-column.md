#### The Application

The app, which is implemented by each framework for each mobile platform, is a tool for searching UK property listings.  This application was selected because it is non-trivial, multi-screen and makes use of a number of device capabilities including page navigation, geolocation, storage and web services.

#### Get Involved

It would be great to see the app implented in more cross-platform frameworks. If you're interested in contributing, a good place to start would be the [list of implementation requests]({{ site.githuburl }}/issues?labels=Framework+Request&page=1&state=open), or maybe you'd be interested in adding implementations of the currently supported frameworks for other platforms? It's all on GitHub at the link above, so fork away! For more detailed implementation notes see the [PropertyCross specifications]({{ site.githuburl }}/tree/master/specification).
