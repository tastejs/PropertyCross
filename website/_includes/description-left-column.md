#### Selecting a Framework

The APK and XAP files for the Android and Windows Phone versions of each framework are available within the project download. For iPhone you will have to build and sign the projects yourself in order to deploy them onto your own device.

Some of the frameworks deliver a native user interface, whereas others construct a native-like interface using HTML5 technologies. When selecting a framework it is important to test the end-user experience that the framework delivers and ensure you are happy with any compromises.

The code-sharing which can be realistically achieved with each framework varies considerably. To aid in this comparison there is a build script which produces code metrics for guidance. Although, as developers I am sure you are aware that [lines-of-code metrics are flawed](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=loc+count+flawed).

It is also worth investing quite a bit of time familiarising yourself with tools provided by each framework. The cost and quality of these varies considerably.
