jQTouch is a Zepto/jQuery plugin which provides a framework for developing iOS and Android applications.  It is both open source and free to use.

jQTouch provides a structure on which to base the HTML, the majority of the application styling, page transition animations and touch based event handling; however, it's not a fully featured application development solution so this project uses a number of other technologies fill in the gaps:

* [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) - a JavaScript MVVM framework.
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) - a JavaScript file and module loader.
* [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) - used to wrap the code so that it can be installed as a native application.

To aid the development process, this project makes use of [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) over JavaScript and CSS respectively.

To view the code and detailed build steps, [see the github source]({{ site.githuburl }}/tree/master/jqtouch).
