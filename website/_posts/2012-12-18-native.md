The native implementations of the PropertyCross application are included as a benchmark for comparison. These implementations illustrate the tools and technologies that are used for native development on each mobile platform. The native implementations also provide a target for the user experience that should be aimed for with the cross-platform frameworks, with the assumption being that the use of native implementation technologies will provide the best user experience.

The iOS application is built using Xcode, the Windows Phone application is built using Visual Studio together with the Windows Phone 7 SDKs, and the Android version is built using Eclipse.
