This is an implementation of the PropertyCross application using [Kendo UI Mobile](http://www.kendoui.com/), a commercial framework for creating mobile UIs that mimic the native look and feel of mobile applications using HTML.

[Kendo](http://www.kendoui.com/) provide a suite of web development frameworks, all of which are built on top of the 'core' Kendo UI MVVM framework. The Kendo UI Mobile framework adds a set of UI widgets for the creation of mobile interfaces. The mobile framework has a look and feel that mimics the native Apple, Android and Windows Phone themes.

This PropertyCross implementation makes use of [Cordova / PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/), which packages the HTML / JavaScript within a native wrapper for app-store deployment. Cordova also provides a set of APIs for accessing native phone functionalities which are not available via HTML specifications.

To view the code and detailed build steps, [see the github source]({{ site.githuburl }}/tree/master/kendoui).
