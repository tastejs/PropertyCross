[Intel App Framework](http://app-framework-software.intel.com/) is a framework for building cross-platform mobile application using HTML5 technologies. The framework started life as jqMobi, a mobile optimised version of jQuery, which was created by the team behind [appMobi](http://www.appmobi.com/). Intel acquired the jqMobi tools and staff in February 2013.

To view the code and detailed build steps, [see the github source]({{ site.githuburl }}/tree/master/intelappframework).
