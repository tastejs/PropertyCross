# Lungo PropertyCross Implementation

## Description
Lungo is a framework for developing cross-platform applications in HTML5.
Lungo applications are run in the browser, similar to other HTML-based 
frameworks such as jQuery Mobile.

Lungo provides 2 main workflows:
### Prototyping in Lungo
Lungo provides a rich set of classes to help decorate basic HTML5 markup. The
markup is then given behaviour and interaction based on the structure by Lungo,
without any developer code being required. Lungo's philosophy is that you should
be able to create a prototype of your application to show basic interaction and
page flow without having to write any JS yourself.

### Application Development in Lungo
Lungo also provides a JS API to interact and enhance the prototype. The Lungo
API is similar to the common functionality you'd see in other mobile frameworks,
such as DOM manipulation (through Quo.js), page routing and navigation, storage
 etc.

## Application
The application uses as much of the provided Lungo framework as possible.
There are areas where we need to pull in some other libraries to ease the
development process (similar to something you'd do in a real application).
These application dependencies are:
* Knockout.js as a MVVM framework.
* Require.js as an AMD implementation.
* PhoneGap as a native application wrapper.
* Maven as a build tool.

## Building
The project is HTML5-based, so you should be able to open `index.html` in a
browser to use the application.

## Packaging
Packaging is done using PhoneGap Build. Communication with the PGB servers
is done with the [Maven plugin](http://chrisprice.github.io/phonegap-build/phonegap-build-maven-plugin).

Ensure that your development environment is set up for PhoneGap build and
signing applications (follow the instructions on the plugin website, but this
really amounts to defining a PhoneGap build `server` in settings.xml and
obtaining an iOS/Android signing certificate.

Run the build with:
`mvn clean install -P phonegap-build`
