            A very simple IOC container with basic functionality needed to register and resolve
            instances. If needed, this class can be replaced by another more elaborate
            IOC container implementing the IServiceLocator interface.
            The inspiration for this class is at https://gist.github.com/716137 but it has
            been extended with additional features.
