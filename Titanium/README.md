# Appcelerator Titanium

Appcelerator Titanium is a platform for developing mobile, tablet and desktop applications using web technologies.

## Pre-Requisites

To run this example you'll need to install Titanium Studio, and depending on your OS the Android SDK and XCode (OSX only).

## Opening the Project

Open Titatnium Studio, File, Import, General>Existing Projects into Workspace.

## Running on a Device

From within the App Explorer tab, Run, Android Device/iOS Device.

## Tips

* In order to target Android API level 14 (ICS) you'll need to modify the Python script called androidsdk.py which for me was installed at C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\2.1.2.GA\android. Within the android_api_levels mapping add the following -

        11: 'android-3.0',
        14: 'android-4.0'
