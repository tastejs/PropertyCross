PropertyCross
=========

This is the [PropertyCross](http://propertycross.com/) application written with the [Enyo JavaScript framework](http://enyojs.com).  The purpose of PropertyCross is to allow developers to compare different frameworks and how they are utilized.

Enyo is a cross-platform and cross-browser framework that enables developers to easily create applications and deploy them to many popular desktop browsers and mobile devices.  See if your favorite platform is listed [here](http://enyojs.com/docs/platforms/).

This application is based on the [Bootplate project](https://github.com/enyojs/bootplate).  See the project [wiki](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Bootplate) for how to create a minimized version suitable for packaging and deployment.
