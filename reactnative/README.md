# React Native PropertyFinder App

This repository accompanies the [tutorial I published on Ray Wenderlich's website](http://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript), which describes the process of building a simple property search application using React Native.

The project was created using the `react-native-cli` tool:

    react-native init PropertyFinder

To run this project you need to fetch the node dependencies using the following command:

    npm install
